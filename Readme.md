# Task manager (Python)

This project is a simple task management application built with Python, designed to run in the terminal.

The application allows users to perform basic operations on a task list through a menu. The available options include:

1. Add a new task  
2. List all tasks  
3. Mark a task as completed  
4. Remove a task from the list  
5. Exit the program

Each functionality was implemented in a separate function to keep the code clean, organized, and easy to maintain.
